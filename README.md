#expedia_hotel_recommendations: Big data problem

This is a kaggle competition. The goal is to predict the booking outcome for a user event, based on their search and other attributes associated with that user event. 

To get information about the data please see [here](<https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations/data>).

This is a big data problem and I used **Pyspark** for the analysis and building the ML models. Also, inorder to speed up the analysis, I used the distributed computing service of Amazon, **Elastic Map Reduce (EMR)**.
